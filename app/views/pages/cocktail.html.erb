        <p>This was our motto for 9 weeks and it has changed us to keep this motto for life. We have spent 450 hours to code and 260 hours of that were remote thanks to Covid-19. It was fascinated to be able to built this project from stratch in just two weeks. It was fascinated to see how remote teams can be working with pair programming and how much can be done with the distributed version-control systems like git. </p>
