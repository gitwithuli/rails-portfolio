  project-case-hood: "A final week project with a multi-cultural team passionate about Istanbul."
  project-case-hood-info: "#TeamOurHood"
  project-case-hood-p1: "It was an amazing experience to work and contribute in an international team. We were so eager to learn and build good websites. It was really hard after Corona Virus epidemic but that just gave us a remote experience as well."
  project-case-hood-head: "Eat-Code-Sleep-Repeat"
  project-case-hood-p2: "This was our motto for 9 weeks and we will keep to this motto for life. We  spent 450 hours coding and 260 hours of that were remote thanks to Covid-19. It was fascinating to be able to build this project from stratch in just two weeks. It was also amazing to see how remote teams use pair programming to cooperate and how much can be done with distributed version-control systems like git."
  project-case-cocktail: "A permanent storage for cocktail recipes."
  project-case-cocktail-info: "Your Margarita is ready sir."
  project-case-cocktail-p1: "It was very fun to work on this project. It was a warm-up project before our real project week started. It was very challenging because of the different models nested inside each other like cocktails, doses and ingredients. After I completed this challenge, I continued to learn a lot more about nested models and Ruby on Rails paths."
  project-case-cocktail-head: "Learn by doing and Rake it until you make it."
  project-case-cocktail-p2: "When I decided to join the first ever batch of LeWagon ISTANBUL Coding Bootcamp I never thought it would be this challenging. I had a little bit of experience with coding prior to the bootcamp but it was really life-changing. It has changed the way I learn. This was the first project where I used Heroku as a Platform as a Service (PaaS). I decided that cloud hosting is really useful and an option that gives much greater peace of mind. It also taught me a lot about the Bootstrap grid layout. I’m planning on doing more advanced projects of a similar nature."
  project-case-herha: "A project to encourage people to save more animals by adoption."
  project-case-herha-info: "Get one of these babies for a happy life."
  project-case-herha-p1: "The reason I started this project was to improve myself with coding blockchain based apps. After the bootcamp I wanted to keep on coding every day and also dig into something I really wanted to learn for a long time. It was a really informative project and more will be coming soon!"
  project-case-herha-head: "It's important to stop thinking and start doing."
  project-case-herha-p2: "One of the greatest lessons I learned at my time during LeWagon’s bootcamp was that you have to stop thinking and start doing at some point. No one knows exactly how software will turn out and work until you get started. It gets easier as you move forward."
  project-case-blockchain: "Simple cryptocurrency and blockchain written in JS from stratch."
  project-case-blockchain-info: "It's time for people to become their own banks. Blockchain at your service."
  project-case-blockchain-p1: "The world of finance had changed in 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto has invented bitcoin and blockchain. Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralized database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). It was an amazing learning experience to create one from scratch with TDD(Test Driven Development). "
  project-case-blockchain-head: "Bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin."
  project-case-blockchain-p2: "Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. It's unstoppable, it's here to stay and it's amazing to learn about how to program and use it."

  me-head-p: "Thanks to LeWagon’s amazing curriculum I discovered a way to get familiar with CRUD and I improved my database skills, and even my math skills. I also benefitted from an opportunity to use cloud services and I have learned how to set-up payment gateways. I’m coding everyday and I’m dedicated to improving my tech-skills."
