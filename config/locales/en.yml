  project-case-hood-p1: "It was an amazing experience to work and contribute in an international team. We were so eager to learn and build good websites. It was really hard after Corona Virus epidemic but that just gave us a remote experience as well."
  project-case-hood-head: "Eat-Code-Sleep-Repeat"
  project-case-hood-p2: "This was our motto for 9 weeks and it has changed us to keep this motto for life. We have spent 450 hours to code and 260 hours of that were remote thanks to Covid-19. It was fascinated to be able to built this project from stratch in just two weeks. It was fascinated to see how remote teams can be working with pair programming and how much can be done with the distributed version-control systems like git."
  project-case-cocktail: "A permanent storage for cocktail recipes."
  project-case-cocktail-info: "Your Margarita is ready sir."
  project-case-cocktail-p1: "It was very fun to work on this project. It was a warm-up project before our real project week begin. It was very challenging because of the different models nested inside  each other like cocktails, doses and ingredients. After I completed this challenge, I've learnt way more about nested models and Ruby on Rails paths."
  project-case-cocktail-head: "Learn by doing and Rake it until you make it."
  project-case-cocktail-p2: "When I decide to join the first ever batch of LeWagon ISTANBUL Coding Bootcamp I haven't tought it would be this challenging. I had some to little experience with coding prior the bootcamp but it was really life-chaging. It has changed the way I learn. This was the first project that I've found a chance to use Heroku as a Platform as a Service (PaaS). I decided that cloud hosting is really useful and peace of mind option. It was also very educating about Bootstrap grid layout. I'm planning of doing more advanced alike projects. "
